# Bubble Tea Layout Design: From Principles to Implementation

This document summarizes the key concepts and patterns for creating beautiful, functional layouts in Bubble Tea applications, with specific examples from the Crush TUI and applied to the Kafui application.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Component-Based Architecture

Successful Bubble Tea applications like Crush use a component-based architecture where:

- Each UI element is a separate component with its own state and rendering logic
- Components are composed together to create complex layouts
- Each component manages its own styling and sizing

```go
// Example component structure
type ChatPage struct {
    header  Header
    sidebar Sidebar
    chat    MessageList
    editor  Editor
}
```

### 2. Responsive Layout Patterns

Crush demonstrates excellent responsive design by:

- Defining clear breakpoints for different layout modes
- Adapting component arrangements based on available space
- Maintaining usability in both wide and narrow terminals

```go
const (
    CompactModeWidthBreakpoint  = 120
    CompactModeHeightBreakpoint = 30
)

func (p *Page) SetSize(width, height int) {
    p.compact = width < CompactModeWidthBreakpoint || 
                height < CompactModeHeightBreakpoint
}
```

### 3. Consistent Styling System

Crush uses a centralized styling approach with:

- Defined color palettes for light/dark modes
- Reusable style definitions
- Consistent spacing and typography

```go
var (
    primary   = lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: "#874BFD", Dark: "#7D56F4"}
    secondary = lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: "#D9DCCF", Dark: "#383838"}
    
    headerStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().
        Background(primary).
        Foreground(lipgloss.Color("#FFF7DB")).
        Padding(0, 1).
        Bold(true)
)
```

## Implementation Patterns for Kafui

### 1. Page Management

Kafui should implement a robust page system similar to Crush:

```go
type Page interface {
    Init() tea.Cmd
    Update(tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd)
    View() string
    SetDimensions(width, height int)
    GetID() string
    GetTitle() string
    GetHelp() []key.Binding
}
```

### 2. Layout Composition

Use Lip Gloss functions to compose layouts:

- `lipgloss.JoinHorizontal()` for side-by-side components
- `lipgloss.JoinVertical()` for stacked components
- `lipgloss.Place()` for precise positioning

```go
// Full layout
content := lipgloss.JoinHorizontal(
    lipgloss.Top,
    messageList,
    sidebar,
)

return lipgloss.JoinVertical(
    lipgloss.Left,
    header,
    content,
    statusBar,
)
```

### 3. Visual Hierarchy

Establish clear visual hierarchy through:

- Consistent typography (headers, body text, metadata)
- Color coding (primary actions, status indicators, warnings)
- Proper spacing and alignment

```go
var (
    titleStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().Bold(true).Foreground(primary)
    bodyStyle  = lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(secondary)
    metaStyle  = lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(accent)
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Performance Optimization

- Cache rendered components when possible
- Only re-render when content changes
- Use efficient string operations

### 2. Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Provide keyboard navigation
- Use semantic styling

### 3. Maintainability

- Define layout constants at the package level
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Separate styling from logic

## Conclusion

By following these patterns inspired by Crush and other well-designed Bubble Tea applications, Kafui can achieve a professional, polished user interface that is both beautiful and functional. The key is to:

1. Start with a solid component architecture
2. Implement responsive layouts that adapt to different terminal sizes
3. Use a consistent styling system
4. Focus on usability and visual hierarchy
5. Maintain performance through efficient rendering

These principles will help create a TUI that not only functions well but also provides an enjoyable user experience that rivals the best terminal applications.
