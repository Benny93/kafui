# Kafui Layout Improvements

This document explains the layout improvements made to Kafui's UI components to enhance responsiveness and user experience across different terminal sizes.

## Overview of Changes

The main improvements focus on:

1. **Responsive Layouts**: All pages now adapt to different screen sizes
2. **Compact Mode**: Special layouts for small terminals
3. **Better Dimension Handling**: Improved propagation of window size changes
4. **Enhanced Error and Loading States**: Better visual feedback

## Responsive Design Implementation

### Compact Mode Detection

All pages now automatically detect when they're in a compact mode based on terminal dimensions:

```go
// In view components
compactMode := model.dimensions.Width < 100 || model.dimensions.Height < 25
```

### Layout Adjustments

1. **Main Page**:
   - Full mode: Sidebar + main content + footer
   - Compact mode: Main content only (no sidebar) + footer

2. **Topic Page**:
   - Full mode: Three-column layout (controls/messages/sidebar)
   - Compact mode: Stacked layout with essential information only

3. **Detail Page**:
   - Full mode: Split view with key/value side-by-side + sidebar
   - Compact mode: Stacked sections for better vertical utilization

## Dimension Handling Improvements

### Immediate Dimension Updates

The UI controller now immediately propagates dimension changes to all active pages:

```go
func (m *Model) updatePageDimensions() {
    if m.width > 0 && m.height > 0 {
        // Update dimensions for all active pages
        if m.mainPage != nil {
            m.mainPage.SetDimensions(m.width, m.height)
        }
        if m.topicPage != nil {
            m.topicPage.SetDimensions(m.width, m.height)
        }
        // ... other pages
    }
}
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

Each page includes a fallback in its View() method to ensure dimensions are set even if the update wasn't processed:

```go
func (m Model) View() string {
    // Update page dimensions if needed (fallback)
    if m.width > 0 && m.height > 0 {
        // ... dimension updates
    }
    // ... rest of rendering logic
}
```

## Visual Improvements

### Enhanced Error and Loading States

All pages now have improved visual feedback for:
- Loading states with spinners
- Error states with clear error messages
- Empty states with helpful information

### Better Component Styling

Updated styling for:
- Headers with resource type indicators
- Footers with more organized information layout
- Panels with consistent borders and padding
- Improved color schemes for better readability

## Implementation Details

### View Component Structure

Each page now has a dedicated View component that handles:
- Rendering logic
- Dimension calculations
- Special state handling (loading, error, empty)
- Compact vs full layout rendering

### Layout Component Enhancements

The layout component now includes:
- `IsCompactMode()` method for easy detection
- Better handling of sidebar visibility
- Improved dimension calculation logic

## Benefits

1. **Better UX on Small Terminals**: Users with small terminals or split-screen setups get a functional UI
2. **Consistent Behavior**: All pages follow the same responsive patterns
3. **Improved Feedback**: Better visual feedback for loading, errors, and empty states
4. **Performance**: More efficient rendering with proper dimension handling
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns in view components

## Testing

These improvements have been tested with various terminal sizes:
- Full HD terminals (1920x1080)
- Laptop terminals (1200x800 range)
- Small terminals (80x24 standard)
- Vertical splits (narrow but tall)
- Horizontal splits (wide but short)

The UI adapts appropriately to each scenario while maintaining usability.
