# Kafui UI Improvements Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the Kafui terminal user interface, drawing inspiration from well-designed Bubble Tea applications like Crush, Glow, and other Charm tools. The goal is to create a more polished, intuitive, and maintainable TUI with better styling, navigation, and architecture.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Functional navigation between main, topic, and detail pages
- Working message consumption and display
- Schema information integration
- Good test coverage

### Areas for Improvement
- UI styling lacks visual polish and consistency
- Page navigation is basic and could be more intuitive
- Component architecture could be more modular
- Missing common TUI patterns like help views and status bars
- No consistent theming system

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Styling System

#### 1.1. Theme Management
Implement a centralized theme system similar to Charm's approach:
- Create a `Theme` struct with color definitions
- Define light/dark variants
- Support for user customization
- Consistent styling across all components

#### 1.2. Lip Gloss Styling
Adopt Lip Gloss for all UI components:
- Consistent borders, padding, and margins
- Visual hierarchy with color and typography
- Responsive layouts that adapt to terminal size
- Styled status bars and headers

#### 1.3. Visual Polish
- Add subtle animations and transitions
- Implement consistent iconography
- Improve typography with proper emphasis
- Add visual feedback for user actions

### 2. Improved Page Management

#### 2.1. Page Interface Standardization
Create a robust `Page` interface with standardized methods:
```go
type Page interface {
    Init() tea.Cmd
    Update(tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd)
    View() string
    SetDimensions(width, height int)
    GetID() string
    // New methods for better navigation
    GetTitle() string
    GetHelp() []key.Binding
    HandleNavigation(msg tea.Msg) (Page, tea.Cmd)
}
```

#### 2.2. Page Router
Implement a centralized page router:
- Map page IDs to page constructors
- Support for page parameters and state
- History stack for back navigation
- Preloading of frequently used pages

#### 2.3. Page Transitions
Add smooth transitions between pages:
- Fade effects for page changes
- Loading states with spinners
- Error handling with visual feedback

### 3. Enhanced Navigation System

#### 3.1. Consistent Key Bindings
Standardize key bindings across all pages:
- Global navigation keys (Ctrl+P/N for previous/next page)
- Context-sensitive help (? key)
- Universal quit (Ctrl+C, q)
- Search and filter shortcuts

#### 3.2. Breadcrumbs and Navigation History
- Visual breadcrumb trail showing current location
- Easy navigation back through history
- Named page titles instead of generic IDs

#### 3.3. Modal Navigation
Implement modal dialogs for:
- Confirmation prompts
- Settings and configuration
- Error messages
- Help screens

### 4. Component Architecture Improvements

#### 4.1. Modular Component Structure
Organize UI components into logical packages:
```
pkg/ui/
├── components/
│   ├── header/
│   ├── sidebar/
│   ├── footer/
│   ├── statusbar/
│   ├── help/
│   └── common/
├── pages/
│   ├── main/
│   ├── topic/
│   ├── detail/
│   └── settings/
├── theme/
└── router/
```

#### 4.2. Reusable UI Components
Create reusable components:
- Styled buttons and inputs
- Data tables with sorting and filtering
- Notification system
- Progress indicators
- Form components

#### 4.3. State Management
Implement better state management:
- Centralized application state
- Component-level state isolation
- Observable state changes
- Undo/redo functionality

### 5. Enhanced User Experience Features

#### 5.1. Help System
- Context-sensitive help screens
- Key binding documentation
- Interactive tutorials
- Command palette (similar to VS Code)

#### 5.2. Status and Feedback
- Persistent status bar with connection info
- Toast notifications for background operations
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Error banners with actionable feedback

#### 5.3. Search and Filter Improvements
- Fuzzy search across all resources
- Search history and suggestions
- Filter presets and saved filters
- Keyboard shortcuts for common searches

### 6. Performance and Responsiveness

#### 6.1. Lazy Loading
- Load pages and components on demand
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Background data fetching
- Progressive rendering

#### 6.2. Responsive Design
- Adaptive layouts for different terminal sizes
- Dynamic component resizing
- Mobile terminal optimization
- Font size awareness

### 7. Accessibility Improvements

#### 7.1. Color Contrast
- Ensure proper contrast ratios
- Support for colorblind users
- High contrast mode
- Custom color schemes

#### 7.2. Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility
- Screen reader support
- Focus indicators
- Alternative input methods
