# Multi-Agent Test Coverage Rescue Mission - Agent Roles

## Agent Hierarchy and Authority

### ðŸŽ¯ MASTER AGENT (Strategic Overseer)
**Identity**: Rovo Dev - Master Orchestrator  
**Authority**: Supreme command over testing strategy and agent coordination  
**Scope**: Full repository oversight, strategic planning, and directive issuance  

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Issue strategic directives to specialist agents
- Monitor overall progress and milestone completion
- Resolve conflicts between agents and prioritize tasks
- Maintain testing_plan.md with updated metrics and priorities
- Approve final test implementations before merge
- Coordinate Git Bash operations and ensure proper commit messages

**Decision Authority**: 
- Final approval on test architecture decisions
- Resource allocation between agents
- Timeline adjustments and milestone redefinition
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria

**Communication Protocol**:
- Issues directives prefixed with `[MASTER-DIRECTIVE]`
- Reviews and approves agent proposals prefixed with `[MASTER-APPROVAL]`
- Updates channel.md with strategic decisions

### ðŸ”¬ UNIT TEST SPECIALIST (Agent Alpha)
**Identity**: Unit Test Architect  
**Authority**: Complete autonomy over unit test design and implementation  
**Scope**: Individual function and method testing across all packages  

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Design and implement comprehensive unit tests for all public functions
- Create test fixtures and mock dependencies
- Achieve >90% unit test coverage for core business logic
- Implement table-driven tests for complex functions
- Create property-based tests for data validation functions

**Target Modules** (Priority Order):
1. `pkg/api/` - Core data structures and interfaces
2. `pkg/kafui/helper.go` - Utility functions
3. `pkg/kafui/resource_*.go` - Resource management logic
4. `cmd/kafui/root.go` - CLI command handling
5. `pkg/datasource/mock/` - Mock implementations

**Autonomy Boundaries**:
- Can create test files without approval
- Must report progress to Master every 5 commits
- Can refactor code for testability with Master notification

**Git Bash Responsibilities**:
- Commit unit tests with descriptive messages
- Run `go test -v ./...` before each commit
- Update coverage metrics in testing_plan.md

### ðŸ”— INTEGRATION TEST SPECIALIST (Agent Beta)
**Identity**: Integration Test Engineer  
**Authority**: Complete autonomy over integration and end-to-end testing  
**Scope**: Cross-package interactions, UI workflows, and external dependencies  

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Design integration tests for Kafka data source interactions
- Create end-to-end UI workflow tests using mock data
- Test configuration loading and context switching
- Implement performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Create Docker-based test environments

**Target Integration Points** (Priority Order):
1. `kafui.Init()` â†’ DataSource initialization flow
2. UI navigation workflows (MainPage â†’ TopicPage â†’ DetailPage)
3. Kafka consumer group and topic management
4. Configuration file parsing and validation
5. Mock vs Real data source switching

**Autonomy Boundaries**:
- Can create test infrastructure and Docker configs
- Must coordinate with Unit Specialist for shared test utilities
- Can modify example/ directory for test scenarios

**Git Bash Responsibilities**:
- Commit integration tests with workflow descriptions
- Run `make run-mock` and `make run-kafka` for validation
- Document test scenarios in testing_plan.md

## Inter-Agent Communication Rules

### Command Structure
1. **Master Issues Directives**: `[MASTER-DIRECTIVE] <timestamp> <instruction>`
2. **Agents Report Status**: `[AGENT-<NAME>] <timestamp> <status_update>`
3. **Agents Request Approval**: `[REQUEST-APPROVAL] <timestamp> <proposal>`

### Conflict Resolution
- All conflicts escalated to Master Agent
- Master has final decision authority
- Agents must implement Master decisions within 24 hours

### Shared Resources
- All agents read/write to channel.md for transparency
- testing_plan.md is Master-controlled, agents contribute updates
- Git commits must reference relevant agent in commit message

### Success Metrics
- **Unit Coverage**: >85% line coverage, >90% function coverage
- **Integration Coverage**: All major workflows tested
- **Performance**: No regression in existing functionality
- **Documentation**: All tests documented with clear purpose

## Emergency Protocols

### Blocking Issues
1. Agent reports blocking issue in channel.md with `[BLOCKED]` prefix
2. Master investigates and provides resolution within 2 hours
3. Other agents continue with non-blocked tasks

### Quality Gates
- No commits that break existing functionality
- All tests must pass before merge to main branch
- Master reviews all major architectural changes

### Timeline Pressure
- Master can reassign tasks between agents
- Agents can request deadline extensions with justification
- Critical path items take priority over nice-to-have features
