## Notes for AI Agents

1. **Before starting any task**: Check the "Status" field and update it to "In Progress" with your identifier
2. **Use the verification command**: Run `go test --cover ./...` to verify coverage improvements
3. **Focus on critical paths**: Prioritize testing main user workflows and error handling
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Use interfaces and dependency injection for testability
5. **Follow Go testing conventions**: Use table-driven tests, proper test naming, and clear assertions
6. **Handle concurrency carefully**: Use proper synchronization for goroutine testing
7. **Test UI components**: Mock tview components to avoid actual UI rendering in tests
8. **Update status when complete**: Mark tasks as "Completed" and note final coverage percentage
